# Magic: The Gathering Decklist Personal Project
## Description
This is a personal project I made that allows the user to store a list of all their Magic: The Gathering cards in an offline viewing system. Multiple online decklists exist, but there are much fewer offline ones available.
## Requirements
Python 3, libraries: Pillow and Selenium.
## How to Use
Run the magic.py file. Then click Create New Database in the top left and enter the name of the database file to create. Click Load Database File to the right of the previous button and select the new file. Enter the TCGPlayer URL of cards in the text box at the bottom of the program, click Add new card, and wait for the operation to complete. One can then select the card in the list and click Display card, wait a few moments, and then have the card be displayed on the right of the screen. Selected cards can also be deleted via the Delete card button.
## Future Improvements
- Card categories
- Card sorting
- Counts for cards rather than multiple entries of the same one
- Scaling for the UI via a setting
- More information displayed on the selected card
- Option to download images for all cards in the database for faster/offline display
- Ability to purge downloads of all/selected card images
- Better debug functionality
- Various code improvements
